# bat-archive-front

This is a frontend interface (written in React) for the
batman-archive program.  The frontend and backend are loosely 
coupled.  They will only communicate by way of messages sent
over the open API.

See the batman-archive project to understand its functions and API.
The frontend is still under construction, but in general terms it
will do the following:

* allow user to log into the batman-archive backend
* allow user to post new data to the archive
* allow user to query archive and view the list of data returned
from the archive
* allow user to edit archive elements

Note: in truth, the user cannot "edit" an archive element because
these elements are immutable.  Instead, he can create a new revision
which will be added to the archive, and the backend will take care of
organizing the revisions.

In the future, it may be useful to allow the user to browse previous
revisions of a given archive element.  That is not a high priority 
at this time.

Top priority goals for the moment are login, post, and query.

## Archive Element Schema
An archive element has the following schema:

Number id
Number masterId
String username
String textData
List<String> tags
String postDate
String hash
String previousHash



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
